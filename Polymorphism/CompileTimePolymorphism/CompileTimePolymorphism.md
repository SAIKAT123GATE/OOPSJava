# Compile Time Polymorphism:

The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Example - Method Overloading


## Method Overloading : 

Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality. Method overloading can be possible on the following basis:
1. The type of the parameters passed to the function.
2. The number of parameters passed to the function.
3. Method overloading cannot be done by changing the return type of methods. The most important rule of method overloading is that two overloaded methods must have different parameters.
