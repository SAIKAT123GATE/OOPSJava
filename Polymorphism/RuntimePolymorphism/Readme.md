# Runtime Polymorphism : 

Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism.

Function overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism.

Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. 

Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class. 

In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. 

The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism.
